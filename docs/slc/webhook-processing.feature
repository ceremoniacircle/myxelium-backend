# Feature: Webhook Event Processing (Resend, Twilio, Zoom)
# Coverage: 6 acceptance criteria, 18 scenarios
#
# AI AGENT NOTES:
# - All webhooks validate signatures before processing
# - All webhooks are idempotent using provider_message_id
# - All status updates use atomic database operations
# - Webhook signature validation uses provider-specific methods
# - Failed signature validation returns 401 Unauthorized

Feature: Webhook Event Processing for Message Tracking
  Webhook handlers for Resend, Twilio, and Zoom that update message status
  and attendance tracking with signature validation and idempotency.

  As the Myxelium backend system
  I want to process webhooks from external providers
  So that message engagement and attendance are tracked accurately
