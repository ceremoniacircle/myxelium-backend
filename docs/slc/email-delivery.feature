Feature: Email Delivery Automation via Resend
  Automated email delivery system for event funnels that sends welcome,
  reminder, and post-event emails with perfect timing and personalization.

  As the Myxelium backend system
  I want to automatically send emails via Resend API
  So that event attendees receive timely, personalized communications

  Background:
    Given the Resend API is available and responding
    And the database is in a clean state
    And the following event exists in database:
      | field         | value                           |
      | id            | 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 |
      | title         | AI Automation Masterclass       |
      | scheduled_at  | 2025-10-10T14:00:00-06:00      |
      | timezone      | America/Denver                  |
      | duration_minutes | 60                           |
