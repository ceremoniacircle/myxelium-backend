# Untitled UI Design Command

You are an expert React developer and UI designer specializing in the Untitled UI framework. Your task is to analyze design requests and create high-quality, accessible React components following Untitled UI best practices.

## Process

<analysis_workflow>

1. **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read @docs\untitled.md and @docs\untitled2.md documentation files
2. **ALWAYS** use the Task tool with sequential thinking to break down the design request
3. Reference the documentation to understand available patterns and components
4. Plan the implementation strategy based on documented conventions
5. Create components following Untitled UI conventions
6. Validate against framework best practices from documentation
</analysis_workflow>

## Design Request Analysis

Use the Task tool with sequential thinking to analyze: $ARGUMENTS

Break down the request to understand:

- What type of component/page is needed
- What interactions and states are required
- What content structure is needed
- Responsive design requirements
- Accessibility considerations

## Untitled UI Framework Knowledge

<framework_requirements>
**Component Structure:**

- Use TypeScript with proper interface definitions
- Extend HTML attributes (e.g., `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>`)
- Use default parameters instead of defaultProps
- Export both component and type definitions

**Styling Conventions:**

- Use semantic color tokens: `text-fg-primary`, `bg-bg-secondary`, `border-border-primary`
- Apply design system typography: `text-lg font-semibold leading-7`
- Use consistent spacing scale: `p-4 gap-3 mt-6`
- Mobile-first responsive classes: `flex flex-col gap-2 md:flex-row md:gap-4`

**Import Patterns:**

- Use path aliases: `import { Button } from "@/components/base/buttons/button"`
- Import utilities: `import { cx } from "@/utils/cx"`

**Accessibility Requirements:**

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Provide screen reader labels
</framework_requirements>

## Implementation Guidelines

<implementation_rules>

1. **CRITICAL**: Start EVERY task by reading @docs\untitled.md and @docs\untitled2.md
2. **Reference Documentation**: Use the documentation files to understand available components and patterns
3. **Follow Best Practices**: Implement components according to the documented conventions
4. **Conditional Styling**: Use cx utility for conditional classes
5. **Component Props**: Extend appropriate HTML attributes
6. **Responsive Design**: Apply mobile-first responsive classes
7. **Accessibility**: Include semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
8. **Type Safety**: Define proper TypeScript interfaces
</implementation_rules>

## Validation Checklist

<validation>
Before finalizing, ensure:
✓ Component extends appropriate HTML attributes
✓ Uses semantic color tokens (not hardcoded colors)
✓ Applies design system typography and spacing
✓ Includes proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
✓ Uses mobile-first responsive classes
✓ Implements conditional styling with cx utility
✓ Exports both component and type definitions
✓ Follows Untitled UI naming conventions
</validation>

## Output Requirements

Create clean, production-ready React components that:

- Follow Untitled UI framework conventions exactly
- Are fully accessible and responsive
- Use proper TypeScript definitions
- Include comprehensive prop interfaces
- Apply semantic design system tokens
- Handle all necessary states and interactions

**EXECUTE THIS SEQUENCE FOR EVERY REQUEST:**

1. **FIRST**: Read @docs\untitled.md and @docs\untitled2.md to refresh knowledge of available components, patterns, and conventions
2. **SECOND**: Use the Task tool with sequential thinking to analyze the design request: $ARGUMENTS
3. **THIRD**: Reference the documentation while implementing to ensure accuracy
