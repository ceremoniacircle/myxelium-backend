Design system architecture based on requirements and project constraints.

Consider project type and scale:

- **Simple projects**: Monolithic architecture with clear modules
- **Complex systems**: Microservices with defined boundaries
- **Performance-critical**: Optimized patterns and caching strategies
- **Integration-heavy**: API gateways and event-driven patterns

Input: $ARGUMENTS

Create architecture with:

- Component breakdown and responsibilities
- Communication patterns between components
- Data flow and state management
- Deployment and scaling considerations
- Technology recommendations with rationale

Return architecture document with diagrams and implementation guidance.
Adapt complexity to project size and team capabilities.
