Feature: Calendar Integration with .ics File Generation
  Generate RFC 5545 compliant .ics calendar files for event enrollments
  with accurate timezone handling and cross-client compatibility.

  As the Myxelium backend system
  I want to generate calendar invites for enrolled users
  So that events automatically appear in their calendars

  Background:
    Given the calendar generation library is available
    And the timezone database is up to date

  Scenario: Generate valid .ics file for event in Mountain timezone
    Given an event exists with:
      | field            | value                        |
      | title            | AI Automation Masterclass    |

    And an enrollment has zoom_join_url "https://zoom.us/j/12345?pwd=abc"
    When the calendar .ics file is generated for this enrollment
    Then the .ics file should be RFC 5545 compliant
    And the .ics file should contain:

  @happy-path @cross-client
  Scenario: .ics file opens correctly in Gmail
    Given a valid .ics file is generated
    When the .ics file is parsed by Gmail calendar import
    Then the event should be created with:
      | field       | expected_value            |
      | title       | AI Automation Masterclass |
      | start_time  | Oct 10, 2025, 2:00 PM MDT |

      | location    | https://zoom.us/j/12345?pwd=abc |
    And the Zoom URL should be clickable
    And the event should show in correct timezone

  @happy-path @cross-client
  Scenario: .ics file opens correctly in Outlook
    Given a valid .ics file is generated for timezone "America/New_York"
    When the .ics file is imported into Outlook
    Then the event should display "Oct 10, 2025, 4:00 PM EDT"
    And the location field should contain Zoom URL
    And the calendar reminder should default to 15 minutes before

  @happy-path @cross-client
  Scenario: .ics file opens correctly in Apple Mail
    Given a valid .ics file is generated
    When the .ics file is opened in Apple Calendar
    Then the event should be added to default calendar
    And the event alert should be set to "At time of event"
    And the Zoom join URL should be in location field

  # HAPPY PATH SCENARIOS - Timezone Conversion
  # ============================================================================

  @happy-path @timezone
  Scenario: Event appears with correct time in user's timezone
    Given an event is scheduled for "2025-10-10T14:00:00-06:00" in timezone "America/Denver"
    And a contact exists with timezone "America/New_York"
    When the .ics file is generated for this contact
    Then the DTSTART should use TZID=America/New_York
    And the DTSTART value should be "20251010T160000" (4:00 PM Eastern)
    And the event duration should remain 60 minutes

  @happy-path @timezone
  Scenario Outline: Generate .ics for international timezones
    Given an event is scheduled for "<event_time>" in timezone "<event_timezone>"
    When the .ics file is generated
    Then the DTSTART should use TZID=<event_timezone>
    And the time should be displayed as "<display_time>" in that timezone

    Examples:
      | event_time              | event_timezone        | display_time         |
      | 2025-10-10T14:00:00-06:00 | America/Denver       | 2025-10-10 14:00 MDT |

  @happy-path @calendar-links
  Scenario: Generate "Add to Google Calendar" link
    Given an event with title "AI Automation Masterclass" at "2025-10-10T14:00:00-06:00"
    When the Google Calendar link is generated
    Then the link should be:
      """
      https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=AI+Automation+Masterclass&dates=20251010T200000Z/20251010T210000Z&details=Learn+AI+automation+tools&location=https://zoom.us/j/12345&sf=true
      """
    And clicking the link should open Google Calendar add event dialog

  @happy-path @calendar-links
  Scenario: Generate "Add to Outlook" link
    Given an event with details
    When the Outlook calendar link is generated
    Then the link should start with "https://outlook.live.com/calendar/0/deeplink/compose"
    And the link should include URL-encoded event title, date, location

  @happy-path @calendar-links
  Scenario: Generate all calendar links for welcome email
    Given an enrollment exists
    When the welcome email is prepared
    Then the email should include:

      | google_calendar  | Add to Google Calendar     |
      | outlook_calendar | Add to Outlook             |
      | apple_calendar   | Download .ics for Apple    |
    And each link should be properly URL-encoded

  # EDGE CASES - DST Transitions
  # ============================================================================

  @edge-case @dst
  Scenario: Handle DST spring forward transition correctly
    Given an event is scheduled for "2025-03-09T02:30:00-07:00" in "America/Denver"
    And this time falls in DST transition gap (2:00 AM - 3:00 AM skipped)
    When the .ics file is generated
    Then the DTSTART should be adjusted to "20250309T033000" (3:30 AM MDT)
    And the timezone offset should change from -07:00 to -06:00
    And a warning should be logged about DST adjustment

  @edge-case @dst
  Scenario: Handle DST fall back transition correctly
    Given an event is scheduled for "2025-11-02T01:30:00-06:00" in "America/Denver"
    And this time occurs twice during DST fall back
    When the .ics file is generated
    Then the DTSTART should use the first occurrence (MDT)
    And the timezone offset should be -06:00 (before DST ends)

  # ERROR SCENARIOS
  # ============================================================================

  @error-handling @validation
  Scenario: Reject .ics generation for invalid timezone
    Given an event exists with timezone "Invalid/Timezone"
    When the .ics file generation is attempted
    Then the generation should fail with error "Invalid timezone: Invalid/Timezone"
    And a list of valid IANA timezones should be suggested

  @error-handling @validation
  Scenario: Reject .ics generation for missing required fields
    Given an event exists with:
      | title        | <empty> |
      | scheduled_at | <null>  |
    When the .ics file generation is attempted
    Then the generation should fail with error "Missing required fields: title, scheduled_at"
