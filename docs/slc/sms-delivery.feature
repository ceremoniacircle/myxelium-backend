Feature: SMS Delivery Automation via Twilio
  Automated SMS delivery system for high-urgency event reminders with
  compliance, quiet hours, and opt-out handling.

  As the Myxelium backend system
  I want to send SMS reminders via Twilio API
  So that attendees receive timely mobile notifications

  Background:
    Given the Twilio API is available and responding
    And the database is in a clean state
    And the following event exists in database:
      | field         | value                           |
      | id            | 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 |
      | title         | AI Automation Masterclass       |
      | scheduled_at  | 2025-10-10T14:00:00-06:00      |
      | timezone      | America/Denver                  |

    And the current system time is "2025-10-10T03:00:00-04:00" (3am Eastern)
    When the Inngest job "send-message" is triggered for SMS
    Then the job should calculate that 3am is outside quiet hours (9am-9pm)
    And the job should delay until "2025-10-10T09:00:00-04:00" (9am Eastern)

  # ERROR SCENARIOS - Consent Validation
  # ============================================================================

  @error-handling @validation

    Given a contact exists with:
      | phone       | +14155552674 |
      | consent_sms | false        |
    When the Inngest job "send-message" is triggered for SMS
    Then the job should fail with error "No SMS consent"
    And no SMS should be sent to Twilio API
    And no sent_message record should be created

  @error-handling @validation
  Scenario: Reject SMS send when contact has no phone number
    Given a contact exists with:
      | phone       | null  |
      | consent_sms | true  |

  # ERROR SCENARIOS - Phone Number Validation (E.164)
  # ============================================================================

  @error-handling @validation
  Scenario: Reject SMS when phone number is not E.164 format
    Given a contact exists with phone "555-1234" (not E.164)

  @error-handling @validation
  Scenario Outline: Validate E.164 phone number format
    Given a contact exists with phone "<phone_number>"
    When the Inngest job validates phone number
    Then the validation should result in "<result>"
    And if invalid, error message should be "<error_message>"

    Examples:

  @error-handling @external-service
  Scenario: Retry SMS send when Twilio API returns 5xx error
    Given a contact is enrolled with valid SMS consent
    And the Twilio API will return status 503 on first attempt
    And the Twilio API will return status 201 on second attempt
    When the Inngest job "send-message" is triggered
    Then the job should retry with exponential backoff
    And the first retry should occur after 1000 milliseconds
    And the second attempt should succeed
    And a sent_message record should be created with status "sent"

  @error-handling @external-service
  Scenario: Mark SMS as failed when Twilio returns 400 invalid phone
    Given a contact exists with phone "+19999999999" (invalid number)
    When the Twilio API returns 400 with error "Phone number is invalid"
    Then the job should fail immediately without retry
    And a sent_message record should be created with:

  @edge-case @character-limit
  Scenario: Truncate or reject SMS exceeding 160 character limit
    Given an SMS template produces body of 165 characters
    When the Inngest job validates SMS length
    Then the job should fail with error "SMS body exceeds 160 character limit (165 chars)"
    And no SMS should be sent
    And an alert should be sent to admin about template length issue

  @edge-case @rate-limit
  Scenario: Handle Twilio rate limit error gracefully
    Given 100 SMS sends are triggered simultaneously
    And Twilio rate limit is 10 messages per second
    When the 11th SMS is attempted within 1 second
    And Twilio returns 429 with error "Too Many Requests"
    Then the job should retry after 1000 milliseconds
    And the retry should succeed once rate limit resets
