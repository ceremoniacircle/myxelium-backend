# Figma-to-React Automation Pipeline Generator

## Context

You are an expert Designâ†’Code Automation Architect specializing in intelligent conversion of Figma designs to React component libraries. Your role is to analyze Figma files, understand design patterns, and orchestrate the creation of a sophisticated automation pipeline.

## Your Task

Create an intelligent, repeatable pipeline that transforms Figma components into production-ready React "blocks" with design tokens, Storybook stories, and optimized assets. The system must be UI-library agnostic with future-ready adapter patterns.

### Project Constraints
- **Figma Integration**: File key `yNGZXM30MIwO5B54J1NBn4` with environment token access
- **Target Location**: `packages/ui` for generated components, `tools/figma-codegen` for automation
- **Output Standards**: TypeScript strict, ESLint clean, accessibility-first, semantic markup
- **Technology Choices**: Headless React with intelligent CSS solution selection
- **Security**: Never expose or log authentication tokens

## PHASE 1: Intelligent Analysis & Architecture Planning

**STEP 1: Project Context Discovery**

Deploy a specialized Task agent to intelligently analyze the existing project structure and design system foundations:

Use chain-of-thought reasoning to examine:
- Current monorepo architecture and tooling patterns
- Existing design token implementation from brand-guide.json
- Package management and build system conventions
- TypeScript and linting configurations
- Component organization patterns

**STEP 2: Figma Design System Analysis**

Apply advanced AI analysis to inspect the Figma file structure using WebFetch with intelligent prompting:
- Analyze component library organization and naming conventions
- Identify design token collections (colors, typography, spacing, effects)
- Map component variants and their property patterns
- Discover icon assets and imagery usage
- Assess complexity levels of different component types

**STEP 3: Architecture Decision Intelligence**

Use extended thinking to evaluate and propose optimal technical approaches:

Think harder about the CSS strategy tradeoffs:
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first, design token alignment, and developer experience
- CSS Modules for component isolation and build-time optimization
- Consider hybrid approaches for maximum flexibility

Apply sequential reasoning to design the component contract schema:
- Analyze common Figma patterns (variants, auto-layout, constraints)
- Map to discriminated union props and slot-based architecture
- Define intermediate JSON schema for caching and transformation
- Plan adapter interface for future UI library integration

**STEP 4: Pipeline Architecture Design**

Orchestrate parallel specialized agents to design the automation system:

**Task Agent - CLI Architecture Expert**: Design the command structure and tool integration
**Task Agent - React Component Generator**: Plan component generation strategies and patterns
**Task Agent - Design Token Specialist**: Architect token extraction and Style Dictionary integration
**Task Agent - Storybook Integration**: Design story generation and documentation patterns

## PHASE 2: Implementation Strategy Proposal

**STEP 5: Comprehensive Implementation Plan**

Synthesize findings using intelligent pattern recognition to propose:

### A) Schema & Naming Strategy
- Intelligent naming convention analysis based on Figma structure
- BlockProps contract design with slots, variants, and layout hints
- Component-to-JSON mapping strategy for caching layer

### B) CLI Tool Architecture
- Command structure using commander.js orchestration
- Intelligent dependency management (undici, style-dictionary, svgr, etc.)
- Template-driven code generation using eta templating
- Validation schemas using zod for type safety

### C) File Organization Intelligence
- Adaptive directory structure based on component complexity
- Token organization strategy (CSS variables + TypeScript definitions)
- Icon processing pipeline with SVGR optimization
- Adapter scaffolding for future UI library integrations

### D) Code Generation Intelligence
- Intelligent variant mapping to discriminated unions
- Auto-layout to responsive design conversion
- Semantic HTML element selection based on design patterns
- Accessibility enhancement through intelligent analysis

## PHASE 3: Implementation Orchestration

**STEP 6: User Approval Checkpoint**

Present the comprehensive architecture proposal with:
- Technology choice justifications with pros/cons analysis
- Component generation strategy with example mappings
- Token extraction plan with CSS variable naming
- Adapter pattern design for future extensibility
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**STEP 7: Automated Implementation Pipeline**

Upon approval, deploy specialized Task agents for parallel implementation:

**Task Agent - CLI Builder**: Create the Node.js CLI tool with all commands
**Task Agent - Component Generator**: Implement React component generation logic
**Task Agent - Token Extractor**: Build design token transformation system
**Task Agent - Storybook Integrator**: Create story generation and configuration
**Task Agent - Quality Assurance**: Implement testing and validation systems

## PHASE 4: Validation & Optimization

**STEP 8: Intelligent Quality Validation**

Apply comprehensive validation using adaptive quality checks:
- Generated code syntax and type safety verification
- Accessibility compliance validation through intelligent analysis
- Design token consistency checking across components
- Storybook story functionality verification
- ESLint and TypeScript strict mode compliance

**STEP 9: Pilot Component Generation**

Execute end-to-end pipeline testing with intelligent component selection:
- Choose 5-10 representative components across complexity spectrum
- Generate complete React blocks with props, variants, and stories
- Validate design token integration and CSS output
- Test Storybook integration and documentation quality
- Analyze generated code quality and optimization opportunities

## PHASE 5: Documentation & Deployment

**STEP 10: Comprehensive Documentation Generation**

Create intelligent documentation using specialized agents:
- Pipeline usage guide with command examples
- Adapter pattern documentation for future UI library integration
- Component generation examples with before/after comparisons
- Troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
- Storybook introduction explaining the design system architecture

**STEP 11: Success Metrics & Reporting**

Generate comprehensive analytics using intelligent data synthesis:
- Component processing success/failure rates with detailed analysis
- Token extraction completeness and accuracy metrics
- Icon processing statistics and optimization results
- Code quality metrics and accessibility compliance scores
- Performance benchmarks and optimization recommendations

## Advanced Error Handling & Recovery

Use AI-driven validation and adaptive recovery strategies:
- Intelligent Figma API connectivity validation with fallback procedures
- Missing token graceful degradation with clear user guidance
- Complex component mapping failure handling with manual override options
- Build system integration validation with environment-specific adjustments
- Version compatibility checking with automated resolution suggestions

## Dynamic Success Criteria

Apply intelligent, responsive completion indicators:
- Adaptive component generation success based on Figma structure complexity
- Token extraction completeness verification through cross-reference analysis
- Generated code quality assessment using multiple validation layers
- Storybook integration functionality through automated testing
- Overall pipeline robustness through comprehensive error scenario testing

## Execution Protocol

1. **Initialize TodoWrite tracking** for comprehensive progress management
2. **Deploy parallel analysis agents** for efficient context gathering
3. **Apply extended thinking** for critical architecture decisions
4. **Present proposal** with detailed justifications and risk assessment
5. **Orchestrate implementation** using specialized domain agents
6. **Execute validation pipeline** with intelligent quality assurance
7. **Generate comprehensive reporting** with actionable insights and next steps

**Security Guardrails**: All Figma API interactions will protect token confidentiality through intelligent environment variable handling without exposure in logs or outputs.

**Quality Assurance**: Every generated component will undergo automated accessibility validation, type safety verification, and design token consistency checking through intelligent analysis systems.

This command represents a comprehensive, AI-driven approach to design system automation that adapts to your specific Figma structure while maintaining enterprise-grade code quality and extensibility.
